# ECE452-s25-group-9

## Rules
* `main` branch will have production code --> changes must only come from merged branches and when changes are reviewed and approved.
* feature branches --> Use to split features into branches for new tasks and to keep your own commits/updates in your own branch.

## To Do
- [ ] Protect main branch from direct commits
  - [ ] Require 1 PR review before merge
  - [ ] Block force push and branch deletions
- [ ] Set up pre-push hook or github action to reject invalid branch names to enforce branch <-> PR/feature one-to-one correspondence
- [ ] Set up issue template (`.github` folder setup) to enforce ticket creation template
- [ ] Set up Android project
- [ ] Pick project idea
